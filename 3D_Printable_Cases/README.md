#### SIZE

**Small**: 130x80x48mm. For our sensors, the main power battery is outside of the case. Tested and works.

**Large**: 160x96x50mm. Designed for fully-contained sensors where all componenents including the battery fit inside the box. Not yet tested.


#### PARAMETERS

**Hole-** Has additional hole for running a USB cable into the box for power. Only really needed on the small boxes.

**-ScreenSide**: Hole is on side where we put the screen

**-SensorSide**: Hole is on the side where the sensor is mounted

**NoScreen**: Removed hole for the screen. Useful if you choose not to have a screen, or want to operate in stealth mode. 


#### 'v#'

Version number. Current version is v8 as of 2022-02-11.


# Printing

Recommended Settings: Worked for generic Prusa-type printer and Cura
- Material: Generic PLA
- Color: Does not matter, but we prefer if each pair of case and lid are the same color if possible.
- Profile: Draft (Extra Fast would probably work too)
- Infill: 10%, Grid
- Support: Yes, density 10%, grid. Only needed for the one rectangular hole, so I used an overhang angle of 55 and - Minimum Support Area = 26mm^2 to avoid putting supports on the letters.
- Adhesion: Skirt
- To reduce the amount of filament use Wall Line Count = 2 and Top Layers and Bottom Layers = 3. If filament is not a concern, use the defaults in Cura.
