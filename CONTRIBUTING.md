Thank you for your interest in contributing! The goal of this project is to make it possible for more people to have effective and affordable safety precautions against airborne viruses. 

If you built your own sensor, we encourage you to suggest improvements or show off a new feature/variation by forking the project and using an open-source license so others can make their own too. We may reach out if we see potential to collaborate on an even better version.

If you find an error in the code or instructions, or run into a glitch not covered in the README, feel free to open an issue. Submitting issues with good descriptions of what setup you have, how you encountered the error, and any workarounds you may have found helps us debug and improve the sensor over time.  This is a 100% volunteer project so we cannot guarantee that we will be able to respond in a timely manner. Until we can respond, documentation of known issues can help others in the community to avoid the same problems.
